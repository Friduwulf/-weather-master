# Weather Master

## Description
Weather master is an application I designed with the intention of showcasing my ability to use third party API effectively. The application allows users to view the weather forcast for the next 5 days, of any city in the world by using the search bar. The application aslo uses local storage to store users' previous searches for so that they can quickly look them up again.
